It helps you design recruitment workflows and track approvals more efficiently. This way, you can hire the right candidates faster.</p><p>To select the right recruitment software, read this guide for all the vital information.

The software lets you publish vacancies on job portals, screen resumes, schedule candidate interviews, conduct background checks, and extend offer letters. It can also capture candidate approvals from stakeholders, making the recruiting process highly efficient.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-deployment-options-for-recruitment-software">What are the deployment options for recruitment software?</h2><p>The first step to finding the right software for your business is by understanding the deployment options. This information will help you select a tool that suits all your needs.</p><p>According to our research, here are the deployment options that vendors offer:</p><p><b>Cloud-based deployment:</b> These solutions are hosted on the vendor’s servers and accessed from a web browser or mobile app. Cloud solutions usually follow a subscription pricing model, in which you are charged per user each month.</p><p><b>On-premise deployment:</b> Unlike cloud software, these solutions host the solution on your servers, which requires you to purchase, set up, and manage your own network infrastructure. On-premise solutions are installed locally on your hardware, and accessed via a desktop application. Some vendors allow users to connect remotely via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p><p>On-premise systems levy a one-time, per license user fee. You may also have to pay extra for software upgrades.</p><p>GetApp recommends cloud-based systems, especially for small and midsize businesses. These solutions don’t require you to purchase servers for storing and processing data, thus costing you much less than on-premise ones. These are easy to customize and scale as per your needs. You can also upgrade your pricing plan to get more features and data storage capacity.</p><p><b>Key question to ask your vendor before you buy:</b> Does your product include a mobile or web app through which I can access data remotely?</p><h2 id="what-are-some-common-features-of-recruitment-software">What are some common features of recruitment software?</h2><p>The next step in the software purchase process is to understand the common features of recruitment software, so that you can better shortlist products. Ensure that the vendor you select offers the following common features:</p><p><b>Workflow management:</b> Create and standardize workflows for different stages of the recruitment process. For example, the workflow can start with candidate sourcing and progress to resume screening, interviews, and salary negotiation. After each stakeholder’s approval (i.e., hiring manager or background checker), move the candidates to the next stage.</p><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/7ptrfyavk151/3UslWoIvTPFMh6lAmnIVF1/81fefb229f333fd35c6aadebced51bbe/Recruiting_process_in_Odoo.png" alt="Recruiting process in Odoo"><p><i>Recruiting workflow in </i><a href="https://www.getapp.com/hr-employee-management-software/a/odoo-human-resources/"><u><i>Odoo</i></u></a><b></b></p><p><b>Candidate sourcing:</b> Publish job openings on different portals such as career websites, social media channels, and third-party recruitment firms.</p><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/7ptrfyavk151/44qJa7ThB0WFCltwsDuTzL/0bc668df80d15279122b2aac4c3e66a6/Posting_on_job_boards_in_Zoho_Recruit.png" alt="Posting on job boards in Zoho Recruit"><p><i>Posting on job boards in </i><a href="https://www.getapp.com/hr-employee-management-software/a/zoho-recruit/"><u><i>Zoho Recruit</i></u></a></p><p><b>Applicant tracking:</b> Track job applicants across different stages of the recruitment workflow.

They are particularly beneficial to businesses who lack the resources to build large-scale customer support centres. These business applications provide all the tools necessary to support your agents in managing their workload and improving their performance.</p><p>Help desk software can be used for both internal technical support as well as external customer case management. These apps offer a more efficient way to track and organize tickets, record repeated incidents and problems, and standardize issue-solving procedures. Common functionalities include the ability to build a workflow, scripts and a customized knowledge base for easy referral by all agents.</p><p>Many help desk applications will enable your company to offer 24/7 customer support through the use of customer self-service portals. These online spaces include searchable knowledge databases, forums, FAQ’s, videos and other self-help documentation. This means your agents have more time on their hands to deal with more escalated issues.</p><p>The case management features common to help desk software allows you to store and archive personal customer information and agent interaction history. Agents are provided with instant access to a range of data from one platform. This speeds up customer waiting time as agents grab the data they need in seconds. Not leaving tools facilitate communication among agents. Case routing ensures specific issues are sent to the right agents. .</p><p>Help desk applications generally feature multi channel support across various communication platforms such as web, email, phone, chat and social media. Use these applications to identify key trends and measure the time spent by agents to resolve specific issues. Customer satisfaction and agent performance can be improved through the reporting tools offered by help desk applications.</p><h3 class="mb-3">Help Desk &amp; Ticketing software features guide</h3><h4>Core help desk and ticketing software functionality</h4> <table class="table table-striped"> <tbody><tr> <td><strong>Functionality</strong></td> <td><strong>Description</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Issue tracking and ticket management</td> <td>Captures customer service requests and complaints by classifying and allocating them to a customer service representative.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Self-service</td> <td>Allows customers to resolve their queries through a knowledge management database without contacting a customer service representative.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Reporting</td> <td>Gathers and consolidates key customer service data from multiple sources to analyze customer satisfaction trends for faster customer query resolution.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Integration</td> <td>Enables help desk and ticketing software to connect with other email, marketing, and third-party software to get more data insights.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Additional features</td> <td>Add-ons that boost core functionality of help desk and ticketing software for businesses seeking to scale with software.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h4>Issue tracking and ticket management</h4> <p>What is the status of customer queries among your support staff?

The former is a more obvious choice for small businesses because the up-front costs are lower, implementation is faster, updates are automatic, scalability is easier, and involves no maintenance costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a quick summary of what you can expect with either of these deployment choices:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><b>Cloud-based: </b>You just need to pay a monthly/annual subscription to start using these solutions. Data backup, patchwork and bug fixes, and all other upkeep is managed by the vendor. Essentially, your data will reside on the vendor’s servers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><b>On-premise: </b>You’ll need to buy the software license by paying a one-time fee. In this case, you\'ll have exclusive control over your data, however, you’ll also have to take care of hosting the software and managing any upgrades or software issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><i><b>Key questions to ask SaaS vendors:</b></i></p><ul><li><p><i>What security measures do you have in place to protect our data?</i></p></li><li><p><i>What kind of security threats have you faced in the past and how have you dealt with them?</i></p></li></ul><p><i><b>Key questions to ask on-premise solution vendors:</b></i></p><ul><li><p><i>How much time does it take to implement the tool?&nbsp;</i></p></li><li><p><i>Do you have any training material/support resources to facilitate knowledge-transfer, so that my IT team can manage the software on their own?</i></p></li></ul><h2 id="what-are-some-common-features-of-construction-management-software">What are some common features of construction management&nbsp; software?</h2><p>Construction management solutions come with wide-ranging features, such as project planning/scheduling, project tracking, and document management.</p><p>Below are the most common features of these solutions:</p><p><b>Project scheduling/planning: </b>Use tools like Gannt charts and calendars to create project timelines and plan tasks.
